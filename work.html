            <h3>DEAD NATURE</h3>
            <p>Keeping faithful to the beauty of dead nature, it was asked to make a colection of experimental pieces where — with dfierents styles and techniques — graphic exploration was used as method and application.</p>

            <h3>ANATOMIC STUDIES</h3>
            <p>Simple portraits (both fontal and profile perspectives) as a corporal anatomy study, avoiding representations of the idealization of the Human body and keeping up with real proportions.</p>

            <h2>GRAPHIC DESIGN</h2>
            <h3>PEOPLE IN MOTION: SPECIAL EDITION</h3>
            <p><em>People in Motion</em> was a project in which — after the free selecion of a playlist — was made a <em>packaging</em> in a "Special Edition" mode, that would conjugate with the playlist's theme itself.</p>
            <p>A list of songs from the 60-70's were selected, thus establishing the theme of the project: The Hippie Activism movement. This had a huge impact in History when it comes to social justice and all the sub-categories that it comes along with, such as freedom of speech, anti-racist movements, anti-war movements, the uprising of feminism, among many others. </p>
            <p>A packaging was developed, always faithful to the visual identity that the project demanded: a printed publication; stickers with several original illustrations that represented the project; a <em>sleeve</em> that encompassed all the elements together; and a stamped bag as a recipient for the totality of the project, also stamped with one of the main original illustrations.</p>

            <h3>ROOF — THE URBAN WALL</h3>
            <p><em>Roof</em> exposes the two poles of social marginality in the urban tissue, that despite its' opposite characteristics and personas, are very much alike.</p>
            <p>In a world of absolute social separatism, where capitalism has control over society, we see divided cities — isolated, forbidden to ever merge or interconnect and communicate. Freedom of speech has siezed to exist, and each person subjects themselves to the class they're attributed to. The fight for priviledge is no longer an option, and individual identity is a mere myth, as we are solely defined by the roof we were born under.</p>
            <p>Through this fictional narrative, "Roof — The Urban Wall" was born. Several artefacts were made, following the creative process from research to conception: an instalation (a project room), four fiction videos (each of which were a conceptual representation of a phase of the fiction) and a production manual, made of four small booklets that revealed the whole progress of the project.</p>

            <h2>PHOTOGRAPHY</h2>
            <h3>SMOKED — PHOTOGRAMS</h3>
            <p>The cigarette is one of the biggest global vices. Is it the pleasureable smoke entering the lungs? Is the the tingleing sensation you get in your fingers that so naturally interlace the cigarette?</p>
            <p>This smoke arises purely of the satisfaction that is oh so procured, but it merely opens us the gates of death — is this expendable, or is it the real and mysterious essence of this unexplainable joy? Is smoke really as abstract and indefined as we see it, or is it as tameable as we are? Reproductible, banal?</p>
            <p>That is how the following project emerged — a series of fotograms made with strand of hair — both positive and negative in its shapes, recreating the so looked-for beauty of the smoke of a cigarette.</p>

            <h2>EXPERIMENTAL WORK</h2>
            <h3>DRAWING & EDITING</h3> 
            <p>Through a series of models and sceneries with randomly allocated books, a study was made as an exploration of transparency, overlays, outlines, graphic stains and colour.</p>

            <h3>DIRT</h3>
            <p>The ambiguity of the idea of "dirt" — representation of an old building and it's dirty front: old, or art?</p>

            <h3>SQUARED DREAM</h3>
            <p>What is there beyond dreams? Beyond the imagination, beyond thought?</p>
            <p>There is no colour; there is no shape; there is no space — there is nothing. There is everything.</p>

            <h3>FRAGILITY ON PAPER</h3>
            <p>The fragility of the material, of the capital, of consumerism. Everything ends.</p>
