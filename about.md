    <h2>WHO AM I?</h2>
    <p>First of all, welcome!</p>
    <p>My name is Camila, and I am currently doing a post-graduation in <em>Digital Experience Design</em>, in Lisbon.</p>
    <p>I was lucky to have grown up in an International School in Brussels, a lovely city covered in a mix of cultures and people. I decided to return to Lisbon, the capital city of my beautiful country Portugal, to study Graphic Design in <em>Faculdade de Belas Artes</em>, and to develop and evolve my professional self in the country I call <em>home</em>.</p>
    <p>I have always had a natural appeal to painting and illustration, which progressed to all sorts of visual arts. The process of artistic creation was something I admired, but what I was good at, was execution. I have a lot of attention to detail, which allows me to have the typically artsy love-hate relationship with perfectionism.</p>
    <p>What I have really realized as I've grown is that what I really love, is people. Interaction and communication are an essencial part of my life and self, and Design, in many ways, works with that. With a modern approach, I believe Design can influence and shape society in great ways, as long as it is structured and well thought out when applied.</p>
    <p>Ironically, this has made me come to the conclusion that my candure towards people would never allow me to be able to reach rational conclusions about what society needs or thinks — but this did not mean my road ended. Because that's when I discovered Front-End Development — a technical, recent, but crucial extent of Communication: what I wish to one day consider my role in the huge procedure that <em>webdesign</em> is.</p>
    <p>I hope you have a good time looking through this page, you will have a variety of experimental works/phases. Feel free to contact me for any questions or requests — and most of all, enjoy!</p>
