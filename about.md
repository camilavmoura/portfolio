First of all, welcome!

My name is Camila, and I am currently doing a post-graduation in *Digital Experience Design*, in Lisbon.

I was lucky to have grown up in an International School in Brussels, a lovely city covered in a mix of cultures and people. I decided to return to Lisbon, the capital city of my beautiful country Portugal, to study Graphic Design in *Faculdade de Belas Artes*, and to develop and evolve my professional self in the country I call *home*.

I have always had a natural appeal to painting and illustration, which progressed to all sorts of visual arts. The process of artistic creation was something I admired, but what I was good at, was execution. I have a lot of attention to detail, which allows me to have the typically artsy love-hate relationship with perfectionism.
What I have really realized as I've grown is that what I really love, is people. Interaction and communication are an essencial part of my life and self, and Design, in many ways, works with that. With a modern approach, I believe Design can influence and shape society in great ways, as long as it is structured and well thought out when applied.

Ironically, this has made me come to the conclusion that my candure towards people would never allow me to be able to reach rational conclusions about what society needs or thinks — but this did not mean my road ended. Because that's when I discovered Front-End Development — a technical, recent, but crucial extent of Communication: what I wish to one day consider my role in the huge procedure that *webdesign* is.

I hope you have a good time looking through this page, you will have a variety of experimental works/phases.
Feel free to contact me for any questions or requests — and most of all, enjoy!
