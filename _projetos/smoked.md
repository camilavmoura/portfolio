The cigarette is one of the biggest global vices. Is it the pleasureable smoke entering the lungs? Is the the tingleing sensation you get in your fingers that so naturally interlace the cigarette?

This smoke arises purely of the satisfaction that is oh so procured, but it merely opens us the gates of death — is this expendable, or is it the real and mysterious essence of this unexplainable joy? Is smoke really as abstract and indefined as we see it, or is it as tameable as we are? Reproductible, banal?

That is how the following project emerged — a series of fotograms made with strand of hair — both positive and negative in its shapes, recreating the so looked-for beauty of the smoke of a cigarette.
