*Roof* exposes the two poles of social marginality in the urban tissue, that despite its' opposite characteristics and personas, are very much alike.

In a world of absolute social separatism, where capitalism has control over society, we see divided cities — isolated, forbidden to ever merge or interconnect and communicate. Freedom of speech has siezed to exist, and each person subjects themselves to the class they're attributed to. The fight for priviledge is no longer an option, and individual identity is a mere myth, as we are solely defined by the roof we were born under.

Through this fictional narrative, "Roof — The Urban Wall" (in portuguese *Tecto — Muralha Urbana*) was born. Several artefacts were made, following the creative process from research to conception: an instalation (a project room), four fiction videos (each of which were a conceptual representation of a phase of the fiction) and a production manual, made of four small booklets that revealed the whole progress of the project.
