*People in Motion* was a project in which — after the free selecion of a playlist — was made a *packaging* in a "Special Edition" mode, that would conjugate with the playlist's theme itself.

A list of songs from the 60-70's were selected, thus establishing the theme of the project: The Hippie Activism movement. This had a huge impact in History when it comes to social justice and all the sub-categories that it comes along with, such as freedom of speech, anti-racist movements, anti-war movements, the uprising of feminism, among many others.

A packaging was developed, always faithful to the visual identity that the project demanded: a printed publication; stickers with several original illustrations that represented the project; a *sleeve* that encompassed all the elements together; and a stamped bag as a recipient for the totality of the project, also stamped with one of the main original illustrations.
